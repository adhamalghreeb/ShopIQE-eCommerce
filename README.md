# ShopIQE-eCommerce

ShopIQE-eCommerce is a powerful API-driven application designed to deliver a seamless and efficient online shopping experience. Built with .NET 8 for backend development and SQL Server for robust data management, this platform supports essential e-commerce functionalities, including product management, order processing, and payment integration with Stripe. Leveraging Redis for enhanced caching and basket management, along with SignalR for real-time communication, ShopIQE ensures high performance and responsiveness. With secure authentication using JWT tokens and a well-structured architecture utilizing the Repository and Unit of Work patterns, this project demonstrates a comprehensive e-commerce solution ready for modern retail demands.

## Technologies Used

The ShopIQE eCommerce incorporates the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Backend Development:** Built using .NET 8, a modern web framework by Microsoft that enables scalable and high-performance web applications, APIs, and microservices using C#. It provides improved performance, simplified development, and enhanced features for cloud-ready applications.
- **Database Management:** Utilizes SQL Server, a relational database management system by Microsoft, designed to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve data. It supports SQL queries, transactions, and advanced analytics for enterprise-level applications.
- **Real-time Data Platform:** Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It's known for its lightning-fast performance, supporting various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, and sets. Redis is commonly used to improve application speed by caching frequently accessed data and is highly favored for its simplicity and powerful features, such as persistence, replication, and support for atomic operations.

## Features

The ShopIQE eCommerce incorporates the following technologies and frameworks:

- **User Authentication and Authorization with JWT Tokens:** Secure and efficient user management, enabling users to sign up, log in, and protect their sessions with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations for Products and Orders:** Full control over product and order management, allowing for seamless creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval.
- **Basket Functionality with Redis:** High-performance basket management using Redis, enabling users to add, update, and remove items from their cart efficiently.
- **Payment Integration with Stripe:** Secure payment processing through Stripe, ensuring smooth and reliable transactions.
- **Basic Admin Functionality:** Administrative controls for managing the e-commerce platform, providing essential tools for platform maintenance and operation.

## Important Frameworks and Libraries

This project leverages several key frameworks and libraries:

- **Repository Pattern and Unit of Work:** Used to implement a clean and maintainable project architecture.
- **Specification Pattern:** Encapsulates business logic for querying data, making code more readable and maintainable.
- **ORM (Entity Framework with LINQ):** Provides object-relational mapping for interacting with the SQL Server database efficiently.
- **.NET Identity:** Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **SignalR:** Implements real-time communication for features like live chat.
- **JWT Tokens:** Used for secure authentication.
- **API Caching:** Improves performance and reduces server load by caching API responses.
